... is a lightweight, browser-based implementation of the [SSAM framework](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23807-4).
It provides the functionality of SSAMs most popular and widely used features in a graphical user interface
with a few functions added for convenience and ease of use. It neither requires specialised computational experts 
nor hardware to handle and process data and thus can be run on a modest laptop.
